# Series
## Getting Started

Run `npm install`

Review the `series.js` file inside the `lib` directory, and then the `series.spec.js` file inside the `spec` directory. Review each of the tests, and then start implementing your solutions to make each test pass in `series.js`.


## Background

For example, the string "01234" has the following 3-digit series:

* 012
* 123
* 234

And the following 4-digit series:

* 0123
* 1234

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string,
you deserve whatever you get.

## Tests
To run the specs follow these commands:
```shell
# first install the new gem to run the tests
gem sources -a http://flatiron:33west26@gems.flatironschool.com
gem install jasmine-flatiron

# to run in the command line run
jasmine-flatiron

#to run in the browser
jasmine-flatiron -b
```
