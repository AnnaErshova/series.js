# Series
## Getting Started

Run `npm install`

## Tests

Run `grunt watch` then edit your files. Grunt will watch for changes. Grunt
will only run tests that start with `it`. When you finish passing a test,
remove the `x` from `xit` to convert it to a runnable test.

## Background

For example, the string "01234" has the following 3-digit series:

* 012
* 123
* 234

And the following 4-digit series:

* 0123
* 1234

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string,
you deserve whatever you get.
